# firstGameBlackJack
<h1>Hi to anyone who is reading this </h1>

This is my first game using JS, so, probably the code could be better, but don’t worry i´ll do it better the next time.
After saying that, you should know that the idea of black jack is to score 21 points or at least more than the computer, otherwise you´ll lose. 
The game has more details of the instructions.
Hope you enjoy it.
